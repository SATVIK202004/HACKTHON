In this stage, we ingest multiple PDFs, segment them into logical sections using heading detection from RoundÂ 1A, then compute TF-IDF embeddings for each section alongside the persona and task descriptions. Sections are ranked by cosine similarity to the persona/task vector, enabling us to surface the most relevant content. Optimizations include caching embeddings and batch processing to meet performance targets.
